16:40,スコフリン Scott,Cleaning out your ass with Darth Vader

19:11,Tucker,Raccoon spotted
21:53,スコフリン Scott,what the fuck? 
22:07,crista,cleo sniffed them out 
23:47,スコフリン Scott,They can't be actual racoons though right? Thought that they were specific to north America
02:22,Tucker,They アライグマ
02:24,crista,isn’t araiguma just a normal raccoon?
02:25,Tucker,Yeah 
02:25,Tucker,But in Japan
02:27,スコフリン Scott,I seeeeee
13:04,スコフリン Scott,just one of the official gmail themes 
13:04,スコフリン Scott,moshimoshi ninjas 
13:05,crista,lol why does it say that 
13:05,crista,i like the ski one 
13:05,crista,why do these look so incredibly bootleg 
13:05,スコフリン Scott,hahahah i don't know 
13:06,Baby Dp,The ski one is so out of place art wise
13:06,Tucker,I’ve been using the ninja fox one for over ten years
13:06,Tucker,Bottom left
13:06,crista,is that an angry referee giving a skiier a blue card 
13:06,Tucker,I love their noses
13:36,Tucker,DP do you play video game?
13:36,Baby Dp,I am game
13:36,Tucker,Or just creating
13:37,Baby Dp,I beat elden ring 
13:37,Tucker,Elden ring ooooooooooo
13:39,Baby Dp,My friend is trying to get me into post scriptum 
13:39,Tucker,LMAO
13:39,Baby Dp,Shit is a ww2 larp
13:39,Tucker,are you getting into it
13:39,Tucker,Man that shit is too weird for ME
13:39,Baby Dp,Way too hardcore
13:39,Tucker,Those guys order panzer chocolate and smell like German mothballs 
13:40,Baby Dp,Lol
13:41,Baby Dp,"Only enjoyable class for me,is medic otherwise it's just impossible "
13:41,Tucker,"ARMA and Squad are for airsofters, post scriptum is for re-enacted "
13:41,Tucker,Reenactors 
13:41,Baby Dp,Yeah 
14:09,スコフリン Scott,"Realistic shooters, at least in terms of physics and combat mechanics are such dog doo"
14:10,Tucker,The core problem is realism isn’t fun unless you’re a psycho  
14:11,スコフリン Scott,Go play train simulator if you're into that shit 
14:12,Baby Dp,See train and plane simulation makes sense  to be. Shooter Sims don't because it's too random
14:16,Tucker,Realistically modeled scopes that wobble and refract if you move the mouse too much 
14:16,Tucker,Except it’s all simulated in real time so quality looks like shit and textures don’t render fast enough 
14:18,Tucker,Also in real life a train or plane is controlled with buttons and levers that can be mapped to a keyboard 
14:19,Tucker,Vs “hold alt+e to bring your arms closer to your body when holding the gun so it doesn’t get shot when you look around a corner”
14:19,Tucker,"“Sorry your arms are too close to the wall, the gun will now spazz out to ensure you can clip through (that would be unrealistic)”"
14:19,Baby Dp,In post scriptum you drink tea to heal and recover stamina 
14:20,Baby Dp,Just like ww2  soldiers 
14:23,crista,hahahahhaa
14:32,スコフリン Scott,The atheist bit at the end really makes it 
10:20,Baby Dp,This game
10:22,スコフリン Scott,*George Takai voice* oooh myyyy
11:57,crista,the ads are starting to make even less sense 
11:57,crista,"now it’s like, a girl with smelly feet is stealing the boyfriend of a girl covered in mud "
11:58,Baby Dp,This one was doctor smells fart likes it and mudgirl gets mad
12:13,crista,hahhhaa
12:13,crista,i wish these ads were longer 
12:13,crista,i seriously love them 
12:14,Baby Dp,https://youtu.be/8UkZGNX0YUA
12:17,crista,yesss
12:17,crista,i looked up the game a while ago and apparently it’s just a match 3 game that has nothing to do with the ads
12:18,Baby Dp,Yeah it's fake games
12:18,Tucker,lol
12:19,Tucker,you'd think that they'd make a real game with all the marketing they've got
12:26,crista,the ads clearly take work 
12:26,crista,i also like merge mansion ads 
12:27,crista,“what’s grandma hiding?”
13:05,Baby Dp,Lol
14:49,crista,https://twitter.com/avalynwu/status/1572321717145702400?s=46&t=Ve3IQmxm89xZsQEhUsQg2w

00:52,crista,i am literally crying laughing watching tucker play it 
00:55,crista,[Video]
01:04,Baby Dp,Lol I thought it was a switch game
01:14,crista,switch with the trobone attachment like they had the drum for taiko no tatsujin 
01:14,crista,"i just tried playing, it’s so hard too"
01:21,スコフリン Scott,This looks amazing

01:27,スコフリン Scott,Hahahahahaha
01:27,Baby Dp,It kinda is if you suck at guitar 
01:28,スコフリン Scott,If only there were people with a real vision behind that project
01:28,crista,at least dp has some ideas for the next brainstorming session 
01:28,Baby Dp,If they put me in charge of the game I would eliminate all the songs except for smoke on the water
01:29,Baby Dp,And you'd be able to vape while playing 
01:30,crista,hahahah 
01:30,crista,the vape peripheral 
01:30,スコフリン Scott,Holy shit 
01:31,スコフリン Scott,"""Give this man a fucking promotion immediately "
01:31,Baby Dp,I would also re name the game to cocksmith
01:32,crista,with these ideas you’re right on track for a senior role 
01:32,Baby Dp,Señor technical designer 
01:33,crista,hahaha

11:33,スコフリン Scott,I like the idea of people in the CIA being genuinely confused like... What? How could people be upset about this?
11:34,Tucker,everyone acts like the CIA is some super puppet master shit running the show behind the scenes 
11:34,Tucker,when apparently nobody thought that htis post would get backlash
13:25,crista,@スコフリン Scott remember how you were like “who’s gonna rent one of those speaker trucks?”

13:37,スコフリン Scott,"but then i'm instantly like, naaah fuck this guy, fuck his funeral"
13:37,Tucker,It’s funny that everyone normal was like “hmm hmm good leader hmm hmm can’t vote for anyone else”
13:38,Tucker,And like the day he dies everyone’s like “oh no so sad he worked so hard for everyone”
13:38,Tucker,And then a month later it’s like “nah dude fucking sucks and his assassin was right”
13:40,スコフリン Scott,everyone in america was way more sad about it then over here
13:40,Baby Dp,"Meghans mom who is Japanese was sad. She was like ""why did they have to kill Mr Abe"""

14:12,crista,3 months is a long time
14:12,crista,everything is out of date
14:13,スコフリン Scott,Yeah it's crazy how fast everything breaks if you don't keep up with the incremental changes 
14:26,crista,yeah if you want to minimize problems you need to run system-setup like once a month
14:27,crista,"though even if you do, randomly something will break and you're like ""well i have no fucking clue what's wrong, time to spend the next two hours running all hte update scripts and see if that fixes it"""
15:19,スコフリン Scott,haha yeah its such a nightmare
15:19,スコフリン Scott,lol
15:20,Baby Dp,Ohhh no
15:20,Tucker,we needed to hear this in 2022
15:53,crista,i've always wondered what incubus's favorite band was
11:27,crista,https://twitter.com/DieAlfaro/status/1575141833159614464?s=20&t=w8xIgilSO8uIc1W2MBeHdg
11:36,スコフリン Scott,the comparison is so strong and i don't understand why
12:38,crista,neighbor's fancy lad cat escaped
12:38,crista,hes' so friendly
12:38,crista,he desperately wants to go back inside
12:38,crista,they have a little window on their door and he keeps looking in longingly
12:38,crista,but they arent' home
12:41,crista,cleo is actually at the vet today so we thought about bringing him in 
12:41,crista,but idk when my neighbors get home so i'd feel weird if they came back in like 10 minutes and i had to explain that i took their cat
12:41,スコフリン Scott,that's the definition of a poor baby right there
12:41,crista,they have really young kids so i'm hoping they wont' be gone for too long
12:42,crista,hopefully they didn't decide to go on a family vacation
12:42,crista,we gave him some water
12:42,スコフリン Scott,"yeah that's tough, don't cant to take their cat, but also would be so sad if the cat got tired of waiting at the door and wondered off"
12:42,crista,yeah
12:42,crista,he seems to be too much of a fancy lad to stray too far from the house luckily
12:43,crista,he literally pawed at the door like a dog
12:43,crista,outside looking in moment
12:44,スコフリン Scott,hahahahahahhah god damn so cute
12:44,crista,crazy though because i think this is like one of those $10k cats
12:44,スコフリン Scott,yeah think you gotta pay like 10k for long hair foldy ears
12:44,crista,yeah
12:44,crista,those neighbors have a really fancy house so wouldnt surprise me
12:45,crista,ive seen the cat outside before but he's always on a leash tied up
12:45,crista,he doesn't seem to know what to do with freedom
12:45,スコフリン Scott,he's not built for it
12:46,crista,took a picture of him then too lol
12:48,スコフリン Scott,that cat could win a beauty padgent
12:49,crista,i know he’s exquisite 
12:49,Tucker,he's the friendliest boy too
12:49,crista,so soft too 
12:49,Tucker,he just walks over and lays on your feet
12:49,crista,yeah not scared at all 
12:49,crista,wants pets 
12:49,crista,there are a lot of strays over here so i'm actually worried he'll get buillied
12:50,crista,"that would probably be the only thing that would make him actually leave the area, if one of the strays came after him"
12:50,スコフリン Scott,that boys not winning any kind of hissing contest
12:51,Tucker,yeah definitely not a cagefight contestant
12:51,Tucker,probably not a great ratter
12:52,crista,imagine him vs her 
12:52,crista,shes tough
12:52,crista,seen her stand off with another neighborhood cat before
12:53,スコフリン Scott,mean muggin' em
12:55,crista,i actually did leave them a note
12:56,crista,telling them that their cat got out and he seems to want back in but if he’s not there he’s probably just in the neighbors garden since he was kinda wandering around there 
12:57,crista,but there’s another neighbor that keeps looking out the window at him so if we took him in to take care of him she might think we’re stealing him 
12:58,crista,he’s just laying in front of their door right now so i don’t think he’s going anywhere 
13:00,スコフリン Scott,yeah its probably fine
13:00,スコフリン Scott,good chance the family has him chipped anyhow even if he does wonder off
13:00,crista,"ah yeah true, i didnt think of that"
13:01,crista,and no one who finds him is gonna think he's a stray
13:02,スコフリン Scott,hahahah yeah i'd hope not
13:02,Tucker,I guess i'm worried that he doens't have a collar
13:10,crista,in other news
13:10,crista,https://twitter.com/HolyWowStudios/status/1574762086214819847?s=20&t=w8xIgilSO8uIc1W2MBeHdg
13:12,スコフリン Scott,real heroes dont wear capes
17:56,スコフリン Scott,earlier today we walked by your guys place to see if the fancy lad was still out and about lol
17:56,crista,hahahah 
17:56,crista,did you see him?
17:56,crista,the neighbors came home around 3 
17:56,crista,i was actually kinda sad 
17:56,crista,for a moment he was ours 
17:57,スコフリン Scott,aaaaah damn we were too late
17:57,スコフリン Scott,we went by about 4
17:57,crista,awww just missed him 
17:57,Tucker,noooo
17:57,Tucker,he was so nice
17:57,crista,i’ll let you guys know first thing if he gets out again 
17:59,crista,would be funny if he became a neighborhood attraction 
17:59,crista,we should give him a name 
17:59,crista,i was thinking either snowball or taro 
17:59,Tucker,gyoza
18:03,crista,muffin 
18:03,crista,pete 
18:04,crista,bojangles
18:04,スコフリン Scott,cant go wrong with snowball
18:04,スコフリン Scott,the most reliable of all the cat names
18:07,crista,yeah 
18:07,crista,he IS mostly white 
18:07,Tucker,mimikaki
18:07,crista,works for boy and girl cats too 
18:08,crista,not to be too heteronormative or anything 
18:08,crista,lol that’s pretty good 
18:08,Tucker,look it's our boy
18:08,crista,綿棒
18:08,crista,apparently that bit is actually for brushing earwax away 
18:08,crista,not just decorative 
18:13,Tucker,yeah
18:13,Tucker,it feels really nice
18:13,スコフリン Scott,my ear wax is way too hard and TOUGH to get brushed away by that soft ass shit
18:17,crista,i think japanese ppl are more likely to have the dry kind of ear wax cuz if i put that in my ear it would be disgusting 
18:31,Tucker,lol right
18:32,Tucker,it comes out looking like a horsehair paintbrush
18:35,crista,lmao eww
18:37,スコフリン Scott,rubber cement brush
18:40,crista,lol
12:05,Tucker,THEY RETCONNED SLEAZEBAGGANO
12:05,Tucker,"""Elan Sel'Sabagno, also known as Elan Sleazebaggano, was a male Balosar death stick dealer on the planet Coruscant during the Separatist Crisis."
12:05,Tucker,"The character was named by Star Wars creator George Lucas.[7] In Star Wars Legends, the character was identified as Elan Sel'Sabagno.[8]"
20:44,Tucker,sounds cool
20:45,Baby Dp,Yeah (Yes)

21:32,crista,"lol alex dropped into a splatoon game i was playing, probably by accident, then he quit the lobby and deleted me from his friends "
21:33,crista,what a weirdo…
21:35,Tucker,Imagining the freak out
21:38,crista,"for a short moment i thought maybe it was an olive branch but of course no, he’s just even more of a neurotic freak than i thought"
23:23,スコフリン Scott,Reeeeeeeeeeeeee
13:15,Tucker,https://twitter.com/bombermanhero/status/1576726436894777344?s=46&t=EsVhhtEYBtM7uC3OYcc-3w

11:32,crista,ryan reynolds is going to tell us about the future of work
11:32,スコフリン Scott,Lol
11:32,スコフリン Scott,Thanks Ryan
11:32,crista,"he learned a lot about working while on the set of ""waiting"""
11:33,crista,in 2003
11:33,スコフリン Scott,Oooooooooo
13:05,スコフリン Scott,Yeah maybe if you're dp
13:06,Baby Dp,It's true
21:56,スコフリン Scott,"Oh wow, what a neat idea"
11:52,スコフリン Scott,I was smoking outside my hotel and willow happened to drop someone off there 
11:52,スコフリン Scott,And now I have to have lunch with her
11:52,スコフリン Scott,Fucking kill me 
11:53,Baby Dp,Lol your in Austin?
11:53,スコフリン Scott,But I'm going to see smashing pumpkins with Jessica tomorrow so that's kinda sick 
11:53,crista,lol she just messaged me and asked if she could have your line contact
11:53,スコフリン Scott,Hahaha yeah some dumb aggops meetup thing
11:54,crista,why is she asking everyone but you
11:54,Baby Dp,Should we do it crista. Should we ruin Scotts trip
11:54,スコフリン Scott,Lol who knows
11:54,crista,hahahhahah
11:54,crista,i have never felt more powerful
11:54,Baby Dp,Lol
11:54,Baby Dp,You can experience the same pain I did
11:55,crista,wonder if they'll play anything from the new 5 hour long album
11:55,Baby Dp,Lol
11:55,Tucker,the single funniest thing that could happen
11:55,スコフリン Scott,She can literally just slack me. Also I'm pretty sure I have her on line 
11:56,スコフリン Scott,One can only hope. I really hope it's fucking terrible I can't wait
11:56,crista,no matter what you'll get to see billy corgan in the flesh so it can't be that bad
11:57,スコフリン Scott,Can't be that bald*
11:57,crista,"also i dont even know how to respond to willow, how do i be like ""its kinda weird to ask me to give you someone else's contact info"""
11:57,crista,lol
11:57,スコフリン Scott,I hope he's wearing his fat ass priest outfit
11:57,Baby Dp,It would suck if they only played stuff after 2010
11:57,crista,that would be so funny
11:57,Tucker,yeah it would suck if they played the hits
11:58,Baby Dp,A concert for only real pumpkin heads
11:58,crista,i hope they play solara
11:58,crista,mime birth on stage
11:58,スコフリン Scott,I saw them once in 2012 or something and the crowd boood because they only played new shit for the majority of the concert
11:58,crista,looool
11:59,Baby Dp,Lol
12:00,スコフリン Scott,"Why does she offer to get lunch???? Willow I don't fucking know you, we were barely tangentially friends"
12:01,スコフリン Scott,We don't have to make plans to see each other
12:01,Baby Dp,Lol 100% she's just going to watch you eat because she's doing ketosis 
12:01,crista,ask for a sniff
12:01,Baby Dp,Lol that is what she did
12:02,Tucker,you should've said that you were seeing smashing pumpkins twice
12:02,Baby Dp,She sniffed my sausage at the renfaire
12:02,crista,why is she asking multiple line groups for your line info instead of slacking you
12:02,Baby Dp,She smelled meghans fries
12:03,crista,isnt sausage keto anyway? she could have had one
12:03,スコフリン Scott,Why did they put me on the second floor of this hotel? I can't even jump off and kill myself
12:03,Baby Dp,Yeah but I ate most of it
12:03,crista,hahahahaha
12:03,crista,now that she knows you're there maybe she'll drop by for a night cap
12:04,crista,just walk up to the check in desk and ask for your room number 
12:04,スコフリン Scott,She also said that I lost weight which is funny because I'm definitely the heaviest I've been since being in Tokyo
12:05,crista,god she has such weird aunt energy
12:05,Tucker,I appreciate that willow has literally left the country and we are still having these conversations
12:05,Baby Dp,She's nuts
12:05,スコフリン Scott,Hahhahahahahhaha
12:07,crista,god damn now i wish scottbot still worked
12:07,crista,i could give her that line instead
12:07,crista,that would be so funny
12:07,Baby Dp,Lol
12:08,スコフリン Scott,Hahhahahahhahahhahhaha
12:08,スコフリン Scott,The cruelest of pranks 
12:08,スコフリン Scott,Because she actually could never notice the difference
12:09,Tucker,considering how rarely you two interacted how would she?
12:10,Tucker,this feels like F.R.I.E.N.D.S.
12:10,Tucker,"chandler bing goes on a business trip and runs into the ""annoying guy"" from season 3 and the studio audience goes while"
12:10,Tucker,wild
12:10,スコフリン Scott,Make it stop 
12:13,crista,i do like how frantically she messaged everyone trying to get a hold of you
12:13,Tucker,yeah she wasted no time
12:13,crista,DOES ANYONE KNOW MY NEPHEWS PHONE NUMBER
12:14,Baby Dp,That's my drunk selfie face
12:15,crista,lol
14:12,crista,hahahahhaah
14:12,crista,doesnt even know his last name
14:12,Baby Dp,Scott scotto 
14:13,crista,i just ignored her
14:16,crista,"i just looked in slack and there aren't THAT many scotts, surely you'd be able to figure it out from the profile picture "
14:16,Baby Dp,Lol
20:00,crista,my god 
22:33,スコフリン Scott,All she ever had to do was look up Scott in her line contacts
02:43,crista,lol is she actually already your friend 
02:43,スコフリン Scott,Yes
04:53,スコフリン Scott,It never ends
04:55,Baby Dp,Willow at the building looking for you 
04:58,スコフリン Scott,Hahahhahahahah
04:59,Baby Dp,You can run but you can't hide
11:30,crista,lmao
11:30,crista,she sent me yet another message saying she found you 
11:30,Baby Dp,Lol
11:35,Tucker,lol
11:35,Tucker,just in case you were wondering
11:35,Tucker,"well it's great scott, you're definitely gonna hear all about it from the horse's mouth"
12:05,crista,how were the pumpkins 
14:04,Baby Dp,Cute 
14:11,crista,hahahah 
14:11,crista,guess she had to figure out your last name to send that 
14:14,スコフリン Scott,Alright you content monkeys
14:15,スコフリン Scott,Just remember I did this for you
14:15,スコフリン Scott,It's all for you
14:15,スコフリン Scott,[Video]
14:15,Baby Dp,I want to know if she is just going to smell your food while you eat
14:16,Tucker,Content
14:16,crista,YESSSS
14:16,Baby Dp,Lol
14:16,crista,thank god they played it 
14:19,スコフリン Scott,It was a blessing
14:19,スコフリン Scott,I was laughing but there was no one to laugh with
14:19,Baby Dp,No one in the crowd is moving
14:19,スコフリン Scott,It was actually on of the better songs they played because they out in a dope drum solo 
14:20,スコフリン Scott,The fuck front of stage has chairs 
14:20,スコフリン Scott,So everyone has to stand in place lol 
14:20,スコフリン Scott,So bunk 
14:20,Baby Dp,Oh what
14:20,スコフリン Scott,"Jessica wanted to sneak downstairs and I was like, why just so we can sit there?"
14:20,Baby Dp,Those are all seats?
14:20,スコフリン Scott,Yes
14:21,Tucker,Noticed they aren’t really moving
14:21,Baby Dp,Hahaha 
14:21,Baby Dp,Makes sense all their fans have back problems now
14:21,スコフリン Scott,Hahahah yeah they couldn't move even if they were under 45 years old hehehehehe
14:25,スコフリン Scott,Dan knew immediately
14:30,Baby Dp,Lol
14:54,crista,omg thats awesome
14:54,crista,imagine getting front row SEATS to the pumpkins
18:48,crista,i did the controller this time 
19:47,crista,i also got a back plate for the switch itself but i had to order a new screwdriver for the hundredth time because i can’t get the damn screws out 
21:25,crista,yeah nintendo has these proprietary screws that are impossible to remove even with the right tools
21:26,crista,"the kit even came with one but it was like, not machined at all? like it was supposed to be a screwdriver but they forgot to carve the tip so it’s just a pointed metal bar "
19:45,crista,young tuck 
19:45,crista,he called the light on top of the taxi the “taxi hat” 
19:51,Tucker,For some reason I can’t stop talking 
19:52,Tucker,Also lol no crista bought a vcr
20:01,Tucker,So I put underwear on my head 
20:01,Tucker,"""And my mom goes “I’ll show this to your girlfriend”"
20:19,crista,"tuckers dad: “no those are not the ROMANS, they’re the PHONECIANS”"
20:19,crista,it’s like a window into the future papa tuck
20:20,crista,this particular clip is so good 
20:21,crista,"“dad, what is mercy?”"
20:21,crista,(dad looks at camera) “how do we explain… mercy”
20:21,crista,it makes so much sense 
20:23,crista,tuckers bedtime story book 
20:25,crista,an actual time 
20:25,crista,tome 
20:27,crista,soooo cuuuuteee 
20:28,crista,"in this video where tucker is sleeping, his dad has a balloon with a string on jt and he wraps the strings of the balloon around his neck like a noose "
22:06,crista,also… since we just got a vcr just for these tapes… i bought an old video camera 
22:06,crista,so hope you guys are ready to make a movie 
23:44,crista,hahahah yeah splice together him and his dad saying “how do you define mercy”
00:07,crista,hahahah yeah like a movie trailer 
00:07,crista,joker 2
00:53,crista,hahahah 
00:54,crista,it works too well
00:59,スコフリン Scott,for some God damn reason
01:23,Baby Dp,Some things never change 
05:29,スコフリン Scott,So much of the tucker lore is explained through this interaction
12:23,crista,"i know, i don't think i've ever had such a moment where everything clicked"
12:23,crista,poor kid never had a chance
14:29,Baby Dp,Gottem 
15:19,Tucker,I think it's just as crazy that they speak in full sentences
15:20,Baby Dp,I feel like I'm on the same wavelength as that baby
15:25,crista,found a good twitter https://twitter.com/MostControPod
15:27,crista,@Baby Dp this you

12:21,Tucker,Live más
12:22,Baby Dp,Lol you went to LA?
12:23,スコフリン Scott,Yeah just for a couple days after the work trip 
12:38,Baby Dp,Noice 
12:40,crista,so close to your big break 
12:40,crista,too bad chapo wasn’t looking for a new guy 
12:48,スコフリン Scott,Hahahahhahahah
12:48,スコフリン Scott,"My offer to be their ""Japan guy"" just wasn't compelling enough"
13:00,crista,foreign correspondent
13:02,crista,just think of how clutch a japan guy would have been when abe was shot
13:02,crista,gotta come up with your elevator pitch for next time
13:06,スコフリン Scott,"""We got scootyboots, reporting in live from Tokyo, what's going on over there? "
13:11,crista,hahahah
13:13,crista,"""it's like something you'd see out of an anime folks - the daimyo has been samurai slashed not with a katana, but with a makeshift shotgun"""
13:14,crista,"""also i just got this farewell email from someone i've never heard of before "
13:14,crista,"""and the """"If you don't know me or we have never had a chance to work together, please stop reading."

13:29,スコフリン Scott,Hahahahhahahah
13:30,スコフリン Scott,Yeah no one says that 
15:36,crista,would you guys wanna get dinner tonight?
15:52,スコフリン Scott,Yeah I'm down
16:21,crista,do you guys have anything you've been wanting to try? if not we could see if we can get in at the miyazaki-ken place that's next to the udon place
16:22,Tucker,oh that'd be cool
16:22,crista,yeah as long as it's not full
16:22,スコフリン Scott,Yeah I do wanna try that place
19:07,crista,what time do you think you’ll be done w work 
19:12,スコフリン Scott,Vi playing dumb internet games with coworkers
19:12,スコフリン Scott,She's usually done around 8

13:21,スコフリン Scott,Oh GOD I forgot about that
13:22,crista,"and it was like a maintenance guy or something, so someone who def couldn't afford it on his own"
14:51,Tucker,Yeah first question is just “what about contractors”
14:51,Tucker,Oh wait if we paid contractors a living wage we wouldn’t need contractors

12:52,スコフリン Scott,on top of having to buy a new phone while i was there lol
12:53,crista,"i was buying a new pillow but figured i'd pick up some other stuff to take advantage of the shipping, so i looked up some hefty bags because im tired of my trash bags ripping when i take them out of the garbage can"
12:53,crista,a 120 pack of trash bags is $20

12:54,スコフリン Scott,"mmmm the super market i think, just gotta look for the ones with the highest 厚さnumber"

17:15,スコフリン Scott,"we were watching some of his early 2000s stand up last night, it was so fucking funny"
17:16,スコフリン Scott,"one of his jokes was like... how republicans are too busy getting pissed off about gay people, instead of caring about our safety (being harder on middle easterners)"
17:17,crista,hellllll yeahhhh
17:17,スコフリン Scott,also the first couple minutes of this jim breuer special is actually jaw dropping https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgxUkmr6AUw

17:23,スコフリン Scott,hahaha yeah exactly
17:24,スコフリン Scott,this was a whole new frontier of racism
17:24,Tucker,this is like trying to write racist humor about lithuanians
17:24,Tucker,or belgians or something
17:24,crista,lol his opener is all about how arabs are sand people and then he just pivots to
17:24,crista,talking about having to take the train

11:26,Tucker,the door is always open to the possibility that moonshoes might be real
11:33,crista,"i was riding a scooter and almost got hit by a car and it made me wonder, what if i was the one hitting people on the pavement"
11:33,crista,hahah tesla namedrop
11:34,crista,i was gonna say this seems like an elon idea

13:48,スコフリン Scott,How is that possible?
13:48,crista,i do not know 
13:48,crista,that seems wrong 
13:50,crista,is it because i was on leave? i thought it was based on company performance
13:50,Baby Dp,I was gonna say did you score a negative 2
13:51,crista,lol seriously 
13:52,スコフリン Scott,It's based on a percentage of however much money you earned the previous quarter I think
13:52,スコフリン Scott,The better your eval the higher the percentage
13:53,Baby Dp,The ol don't let the door hit you on the way out bonus
13:55,crista,then it seems like the bonus should have been 0 since i made no money last quarter 
13:55,crista,i guess i shouldn’t complain 
16:23,Baby Dp,So I went to see death from above and it turns out bass dude vape with same vape I have

18:29,Tucker,Yeah
18:29,crista,didn’t realize this is his every day 
18:29,Tucker,If you scream and yell and do basically anything to get some reaction from people and they ignore you through it all
18:30,スコフリン Scott,Yeeeeeah

16:49,crista,why not at least call her a blue hair sjw or something 
17:18,Baby Dp,Corny 
11:31,スコフリン Scott,The missing link to my boner 
15:25,crista,"guy in one of my meetings just said some ominous shit about ""hearing something about budget cuts"" but then he didn't want to say anymore "
15:25,crista,now hes got me worried
15:34,スコフリン Scott,yikesareeno
16:25,Baby Dp,Meghan went to Austin 2 weeks ago and they told everyone this was last thing they can expense 
16:25,Baby Dp,They couldn't expense food
16:27,スコフリン Scott,wooooooow
16:29,crista,lol fuck that sucks 
16:29,Tucker,what the fuck
16:30,crista,probably would have cancelled the trip if they could 
16:30,crista,i decided to look on blind to see what people were saying since i had a feeling the guy i was talking to heard whatever he heard on there 
16:30,crista,this thread about the holiday gift is making me cry laughing 
16:33,スコフリン Scott,hahahahahahahah
17:28,Baby Dp,Lol
17:29,スコフリン Scott,Why does anyone care what the company gift is
17:51,crista,its blind they care about everything
17:51,crista,its sole purpose is to complain
17:52,crista,i am kinda mad though that there's no option to donate the money in lieu of the gift this year though since i dont want the shoes
17:57,スコフリン Scott,Oh yeah that's strange they didn't offer that
10:30,Tucker,2 sauces
10:30,スコフリン Scott,2 sauces 
19:46,crista,eeeeew
21:30,Tucker,Reverse racism
22:01,スコフリン Scott,disgusting
11:46,Baby Dp,So i had lunch with Eddie the uxd director today. He basically told meghan that so far no layoffs but he has told managers that if it does come to lqyoffs the inital plan is 5% per team. So basically the people not pulling weight are at risk of cuts if it comes to it
11:47,Baby Dp,But yeah budget is tight as hell now
11:48,Baby Dp,They just doing preparing for worst case so managers have some targets on bad performers..
11:49,Baby Dp,But also a lot of managers have targets on their back too because there are some real bad ones. 
11:50,Baby Dp,Also they have some juicey salaries
11:58,crista,god if they do have to get rid of people it would be great if they started with managers
12:00,Baby Dp,Yeah several managers in sf and austin are probaly getting blasted
12:00,Baby Dp,Dunno if any of this affects tokyo
12:00,crista,yeah i’ve been wondering about that too 
12:01,Baby Dp,Seems like it might be a usa thing because salaries are way higher
12:01,crista,yeah that’s what i was thinking 
12:02,crista,also since the yen is worth nothing right now we cost even less lol
12:02,Baby Dp,Like meghans manager they trying to boot his ass
12:02,crista,lol really? 
12:03,Baby Dp,Yeah some other manager was going to quit because of her manager and they were like nah dont we getting rid of this dude
12:04,Baby Dp,Fucking game of thrones usa side for managers and directors
12:04,crista,wow that’s actually pretty scary 
12:04,Baby Dp,Also tomas is fucking ballin
12:05,crista,like salary?
12:05,Baby Dp,He leaving tokyo and buolt himself a compound in his home country
12:05,Baby Dp,Worth 1 million dollars

12:07,crista,that is very weird 
12:07,Baby Dp,Hia man cave is going to have a statue of jordan peterson
12:08,crista,he should just invite jordan peterson to live there 
12:08,crista,he’d probably accept 
12:08,Baby Dp,As long as it aint woke
12:09,Baby Dp,But yeah must have been getting either massive ltips or had a 200k salary in tokyo
12:10,Baby Dp,Probably both
12:10,crista,yeah prob both 
12:11,Baby Dp,Also no one can transfer to seattle or sf because salaries too high. People can only transfer to locations with lower salaries
12:11,crista,czech republic is also prob cheaper than here 
12:12,Baby Dp,For sure
12:12,スコフリン Scott,He probably just had to sell his extra ps5s

16:30,crista,i want to call it a fall from grace but honestly it seems like something else entirely
16:30,スコフリン Scott,the first track has 11 million plays
16:31,Tucker,https://genius.com/Disturbed-divisive-lyrics
16:31,Tucker,I like these extremely angry lyrics that could be about literally anyone right now
16:32,Tucker,"""huh this kind of sounds like something I'd listen to"""
16:32,Tucker,"They have often cited their influences as Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, Metallica, Pantera, Iron Maiden, Queensrÿche, and Soundgarden."
16:32,Tucker,ah. nevertheless this is cringe
16:33,スコフリン Scott,NOOOOOO disturbed isn't cool enough to stan Queensrÿche
16:33,Tucker,some apples get launched far from the tree

16:54,Tucker,Mr. Disturbed said that
16:54,スコフリン Scott,damn that's a bummer.... always thought DISTURBED would have better politics
16:54,Tucker,it's ok they are pro choice
16:54,Tucker,I googled this because I wanted to know if it was okay to rock along to a guy that doesn't like joe biden
16:55,Tucker,"""Why do we love to hate? This insanity...embedded in our hearts"""

01:19,Tucker,"https://twitter.com/indianloonie/status/1597765500788150273?s=46&t=KHqbewo0hpsblD62xxkQOw"
01:36,スコフリン Scott,SAVage
09:51,Tucker,BADvage
16:19,crista,oh god
16:20,crista,"please sir i beg you, dont do this"
16:20,crista,this is because i mentioned that the term 'gaslighting' comes from a movie
16:21,スコフリン Scott,HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHahahh
16:21,スコフリン Scott,OF ALL THE WORDS YOU COULD USE AS AN EXAMPLE
16:21,スコフリン Scott,come on buddy
16:21,crista,why would you do this
16:21,crista,i can think of another n word that used to be acceptable too
16:21,crista,jesus
16:22,スコフリン Scott,there are so so so many other words you could use
16:22,スコフリン Scott,actually the word colored was socially acceptable as late as 1965 *push up glasses*
16:23,Tucker,showing a bit too much of your hand here buddy
16:23,crista,yeah somehow seems like he might trot this one out frequently
16:23,スコフリン Scott,hahahahahaha
16:24,スコフリン Scott,setting the record straight
16:25,Tucker,appreciate that he sourced the claim
16:25,Tucker,because he thinks this is Very Important
16:26,スコフリン Scott,its so funny with the image in there
16:26,crista,i know lmao
16:26,crista,kinda just want to post this in there
16:26,スコフリン Scott,hahahahahahahahha
16:26,スコフリン Scott,yeah
16:28,Tucker,"you could've been like ""yeah jobby isn't a good word to use in the UK or Ireland (heart balloon)"
16:28,Tucker,"""ha ha isn't that funny"""
16:29,スコフリン Scott,wooooooow that's kinda true though isn't it
16:30,スコフリン Scott,the response makes no sense to me
16:30,crista,"yeah is he saying ""i am aware that you can call people a negro in spanish""?"
16:31,スコフリン Scott,maybe because negro is just spanish for black?
16:31,crista,oh maybe
16:31,crista,i was considering going in to the office tomorrow for the holiday event
16:31,crista,but this interaction has instantly changed my mind
16:32,crista,i do not want to meet or talk to these people
16:32,スコフリン Scott,hahahahahaahahahaha
16:32,crista,uh oh popa is typing now
16:32,crista,leave it alone popa
16:32,スコフリン Scott,sock it to me popa
16:32,スコフリン Scott,NO NO NO
16:32,スコフリン Scott,keep going
16:33,スコフリン Scott,choosing his words so carefully
16:33,crista,he keeps starting typing and then stops lol
16:33,crista,i think we're gonna get some heat
16:33,crista,typing again
16:33,スコフリン Scott,i'm chomping at the bit over here
16:34,crista,the suspense is killing me
16:34,スコフリン Scott,POPAAAAAAA
16:35,スコフリン Scott,pfffft boring
16:35,crista,yeah
16:35,crista,but this tanner fella seems like enough of an asshole to come back
16:35,Tucker,why is this converstaion happening at all
16:35,crista,i cant wait for this to get overtly political
16:35,crista,yay
16:36,crista,Tanner Gary Lund 
16:36,crista,three word name
16:36,crista,bad sign
16:36,スコフリン Scott,"it's such a funny tid bit to be like ACTUALLY about, because that is something that literally any american would know - martin luther king uses negro in his speeches"
16:38,crista,it's also a weird example to use because the common usage of it changed because of RACISM
16:38,crista,"that's sort of, artificial language evolution"
16:38,スコフリン Scott,hahahahah true
16:38,crista,when you stop using a word on purpose because it's offensive
16:38,スコフリン Scott,hahahahhahahah yeah
16:40,Tucker,think a lot of this conversation could have been kept in drafts for a bit longer
16:41,Tucker,why would you post this shit on slack
16:46,crista,also i can't help but think that anyone who would complain about the bastardization of the term gaslighting can only be someone who has been accused of it before
16:48,スコフリン Scott,hahahahha yeah no question about that
16:49,crista,look i may be abusive but i'm not a gaslighter
16:50,Tucker,^gaslighter behavior

12:17,Tucker,"""""""Panasonic Interactive Media, or PIM, released Secret Writer's Society on February 10, 1998. It was an edutainment game intended to teach children the basics of grammar and writing. After a series of lessons on how to write, format and edit one's work, the program could read out what the user had written in a text-to-speech format. Of course, the game couldn't be allowed to read out swear words if the user had written them--this is a children's game, after all! So the game contained a list of forbidden words within its code, which, if typed out, would not be voiced."
